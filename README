🚀 Express + Node.js API Setup Guide (StockFlow)
StockFlow is a streamlined web-based application meticulously designed to simplify stock management for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Forget the hassle of manual record-keeping—StockFlow empowers business owners and their teams with real-time visibility and control over their inventory, ensuring they never miss a sale due to unexpected stockouts.

Built with the modern MERN stack (Express.js, React, Node.js) and a robust MySQL database using Prisma ORM, StockFlow offers a responsive and intuitive interface along with a high-performance backend. This provides a fast, secure, and user-friendly experience across all devices.

🔑 Key Features
Effortless Product Management Add, update, or delete product information with ease—your inventory stays accurate and always up-to-date.

Smart Transaction Logging Seamlessly log incoming stock (purchases) and outgoing stock (sales). Each transaction auto-updates inventory levels instantly.

Low Stock Alerts StockFlow tracks your inventory thresholds and sends alerts when stock is low—ensuring timely restocking and reducing potential losses.

Insightful Sales Reports Generate weekly or monthly sales reports to understand product performance and customer buying trends.

Secure Access Control Role-based access and JWT authentication ensure that only authorized users can manage inventory and transactions.

🧪 Testing
Testing is implemented using:

Jest: A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
Supertest: A Super-agent driven library for testing Node.js HTTP servers.
These tools ensure your API endpoints are functioning reliably under all conditions.
